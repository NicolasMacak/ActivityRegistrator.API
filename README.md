# Activity Registrator
This is the backend project. Frontend is here [ActivityRegisrator.FE](https://github.com/NicolasMacak/ActivityRegistrator.FE)

## Overview

This web application is designed to streamline the management of a dance school, including its teachers, students, and events.

My aim is to minimize costs by leveraging free-tier services wherever possible.
